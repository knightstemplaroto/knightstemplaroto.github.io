      <p>Knights Templar Oasis is holding an art show for Mail Art. We're defining Mail Art as any artistic work that can be sent through the mail on its own, without needing to be put in an envelope, box, etc. Think postcards, but anything that makes it to us through standard mail will be accepted. Any art form (drawing, painting, digital prints, etc) is ok.</p>
      <p>Submission window will run from January to March, with the opening happening at the spring equinox.</p>
