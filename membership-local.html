    <h1>Local Membership</h1>
  </header>

  <div>
    <p>Membership at the local level brings with it both a set of Entitlements and a set of Responsibilities.</p>
    <p>Membership in the Knights Templar Oasis involves making a pledge to support the local body. By filling out the
      pledge and fulfilling that pledge one maintains the status of member in good standing. A pledge is a tool for the
      officers to track the status of its members and develop a workable budget. Pledges can be adjusted at anytime by
      submitting a new pledge form to the Treasurer.</p>
    <p>Pledges are the single most important tool for planning and budgeting. Therefore maintaining one’s pledge will be
      the single most important criteria for maintaining membership. A pledge is simply a commitment one makes to
      support something they choose to be a part of: the amount of the pledge is secondary to fulfilling your pledge.

        encouraged to attend our periodic meetings and have a voice in how the Knights Templar Oasis is run.
        <strong>SPEAK UP!</strong> This is your local body, where do you want to see it go? Should we do more classes,

        want it to be!
      </li>

    <h2>Local Responsibilites</h2>
    <p>Along with the entitlements, membership brings some responsibilities; these responsibilities should not be
      considered burdens, rather they are natural consequences of privilege.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Honesty: In order to maintain a community space for performing our rituals, we need to ensure our financial
        viability, to that end we ask that you deliver on that to which you commit. Whatever pledge amount you arrange
        with the Treasurer is expected to be maintained. Please do what you can to ensure you follow through on your
        commitments.</li>
      <li>Activity: We expect that members will attend the bi-annual business meetings and offer input and suggestions
        that would mold the Knights Templar Oasis into the community that its member’s desire. To that end, having a
        voice is important and we strongly encourage the sharing of your ideas.</li>
      <li>Fraternity: We expect that all members treat each other with respect and dignity, there is no requirement or
        need to get along, but civility is mandatory. If you find yourself having a personal problem with any other
        member please use the Path of Mediation to resolve your situation.</li>
      <li>Cleanliness: We expect that each member clean up after themselves after functions, our temple is a sacred
        space, and we owe it to ourselves to keep it clean.</li>
      <li>Awareness: We expect all members to be familiar with all posted policies of the O.T.O. and Knights Templar
        Oasis (Minerval Guide, Local Body Policies, etc). Membership is a choice and to that end we should consider how
        our personal acts reflect on the group as a whole.</li>
    </ul>
